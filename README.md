### Backapp. ###

Backapp is a tool for developing high-performance web **APP**lications built on top of [**BACK**boneJS](http://backbonejs.org).

[Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) provides no `Application` object or class itself. The *backbone* of [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) is its `Model` and `Collection` classes, which implement the Observer Pattern and introduce functional programming abstractions.

Backapp adds `Application`, `State`, and `PersistenceStrategy` classes into the mix.

These classes provide functionality for behaving optimistically, compensating for network latency, and returning to previous states when the need arises, and distinguish backapps as web **APP**lications that are as capable of moving **BACK**ward to previous states, as they are following the user's path forward to new ones.
