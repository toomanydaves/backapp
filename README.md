### Backapp. ###

**BACKAPP** is a tool for developing high-performance web **APP**lications built on top of [**BACK**boneJS](http://backbonejs.org).

Reflective of its commitment to the principle, *try to not do too much, but to do that well* (a decision in no small part responsible for its continued popularity), **Backbone** provides no `Application` object or class itself. That which **Backbone** does provide, namely `Model` and `Collection` classes implementing the Observer Pattern and introducing functional programming abstractions â€“ it, indeed, does well.

**BACKAPP** introduces `Application`, `State`, and `PersistenceStrategy` classes into the mix.

These classes provide functionality for behaving optimistically, compensating for network latency, and returning to previous states when the need arises, distinguishing **BACKAPPS** as **APP**lications that are as capable of moving **BACK**ward through their previous states, as they are following the user's path forward to new ones.
